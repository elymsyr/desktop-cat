To do:

zparser.py - better exceptions and better parsing still needed !!

zanimations.py - parser is added. There must be functions to perform the actions such as hiding book etc.

contol if json file is unspoilt and exist. ask the user if unspoilt, create a new one if not exist.

a better func&var naming may be required !!
 
docstrings still missing ??
