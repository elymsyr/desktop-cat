To d

1 - DONE zparser.py - better exceptions and better parsing still needed !!

2 - DONE? control if json file is unspoilt and exist. ask the user if unspoilt, create a new one if not exist.

3 - zanimations.py - parser is added. There must be functions to perform the actions such as hiding book etc.

4 - a better func&var naming may be required !!
 
5 - docstrings still missing ??










check every py for delete_key if it was used only for workloads.
