The project is giving a little cat I called Non-Toothless which sits on your taskbar many functionalities. Currently It can only sits and can done some simple actions without any real function. You can check the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for the planned future of Non-Toothless. 

The main function is the 'Workload'. It is a system that saves the applications you are currently using and their status (For example, the VSCode and your projects and files currently open in it, the sites open in the web browser, etc.) and allows you to quickly restore them whenever you want.

- [ ]  App drawer (can be cancelled in the future)
- [ ]  Graph analyzer (can be cancelled in the future)
